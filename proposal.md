Initial proposal was to create an attendance-like app for coaches to use for their teams on a daily basis.
This app would have information on each player about their personal info and contact info. However, I didn't have enough time to fully implement everything and I was having too much trouble with teh project as a whole. I believe that I will work on this during the intensive. So, my new proposal is a platform where users can create an account and write a sports article about any sports topic. These articles are meant to be very opinionated for the user. That's the best part. Users can write an article about any sports topic and write whatever opinion they have on the topic.
